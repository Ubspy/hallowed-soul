First the velocity is slowed by a friction force,
both axes are independantly slowed.

This is done by decreasing the magnitude of velocity by `friction * delaTime` each frame.
We also need to check if the velocity of the player is larger than move speed of the player.
This will only happen if we're dodging, and we need to slow down accordingly.

If we are giving movement input, we want to accelerate in that direction.
We want to set the moveVec to the unit vector, we don't want diagonal movement to be faster
than purely lateral movement.

We only want to accelerate is the velocity hasn't reached the movement velocity.
